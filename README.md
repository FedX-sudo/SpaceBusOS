The official hub of the SpaceBusOS project. 

A mobile operating system to take you to the stars. 

Please note: this is a project which I will be using to compete in a science fair. 

See https://gitlab.com/spacebus-os/ for more details. This is in very early development and any contributions are apreciated.
